        <h3>This pasta salad recipe was given to me by a dear friend many years ago, and I've been making it ever since! It's great for barbecues.</h3>
        <p>I was looking for a new pasta salad and I came across this one. It was perfect. I didn't change a thing. Pasta salad doesn't usually go over big at my parties....I ran out of this one and everyone left with a copy of the recipe.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>1 pound tri colored pasta</li>
    <li>1 bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
    <li>6 tablespons salad seasoning mix</li>
    <li> 2 cups cherry tomates, dived</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
    <li>1/2 yellow bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>1 can black olives, chopped</li>
   </ul>
   <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes; rinse under cold water and drain.</li>
    <li>Whisk Italian dressing and salad spice mix together until smooth.</li>
    <li>Combine pasta, tomatoes, bell peppers, and olives in a salad bowl; pour dressing over salad and toss to coat. Refrigerate salad, 8 hours to overnight</li>
   </ol>
